    <h2>ABOUT US</h2><br>
    <p>Makeup is all about having fun and expressing yourself. After years of experience as a makeup artist, I learn that, despite the readily-available shades in the market, women love mixing their own colours to achieve a one-of-a-kind and individual look. There is no one colour to suit every occasion.
	I personally devised natural-looking and blendable shades for the Lip Lacquer that complement different skin tones - from fair to medium to dark. This allows you to experiment with colours and come up with shades that are uniquely you.
	The shades are named after my favourite cities and the shades capture the essence of every city with lightly scented melon to perk you up anytime, anywhere.</p>
